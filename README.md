jeckyll-bootstrap-layout
========================

This is a *very* simple bare-bones [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) template/layout for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the static blog generator.

Motivation
----------

There are a number of fairly advanced static blog generators that are built on top on Jekyll, including [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) and [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). I wanted to understand basic Jekyll before using these more advanced tools, and I also wanted to quickly start theming my blog using Bootstrap. I was unable to find a basic bare bones Bootstrap template/layout for Jekyll.

To Use
------

After installing Jekyll, simply replace the single default.html in the _layouts directory and copy across and replace the config settings in _config.yml. You don't need to immediately install Bootstrap as the template links to a version kindly provided by [BootstrapCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/). You can play with a number of themes by editing the commented-out links in default.html.
